Sms Integration using Spring boot and Twillio

This project demonstrates how to integrate SMS functionality into a Spring Boot application using Java and Twilio, a cloud communications platform.

# Prerequisites: 
Before running the application, make sure you have the following:

Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
Apache Maven installed to manage project dependencies.
A Twilio account. Sign up for a free account to obtain the required credentials.
Getting Started
Follow the steps below to set up and run the project:

# Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/sms-integration.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd sms-integration
Open the src/main/resources/application.properties file and update the following properties with your Twilio account details:

# properties
twilio.accountSid=YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
twilio.authToken=YOUR_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN
twilio.phoneNumber=YOUR_TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER

Build the project using Maven:
mvn clean install

# Run the Spring Boot application:
mvn spring-boot:run
The application will start running on http://localhost:8080.

Sending an SMS
To send an SMS message, use a tool like Postman to make a POST request to http://localhost:8080/sms with the following JSON payload in the request body:

{
    "toPhoneNumber": "+1234567890",
    "message": "Hello, this is a test message!"
}

Replace +1234567890 with the destination phone number where you want to send the SMS.

# Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while building or running the application, double-check your Twilio account credentials and ensure they are correctly set in the application.properties file.
Make sure you have a valid phone number registered with Twilio or purchased from them to send SMS messages.
